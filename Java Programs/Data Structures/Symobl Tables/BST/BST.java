/*
  Associative Array Abstraction to implement Symbol Table (Map) interface (data type):
  for Comparable type keys: Key extends Comparable<Key>

  Array impelementation Limitaions:

  1. Binary Search Array requires array resizing because of static nature of arrays and dynmaic nature of symbol tables
  2. Binary Search Array requires Linear Time insertion/deletion to preserve the SORTED order of the keys in the keys array:
     For client applications that use symbol table in their inner loop, with Linear number of insertions and deletions (N), 
     Binary Search Array performance would degenerate to Quadratic O(N^2) and this is not useful for application for many insertion

  LinkedList Implementation Solution:

  In order to overcome two major issues mentioned above we can use Binary Search Tree abstraction implemented by LinkedLists to implement Symbol Table interface
  with Comparable type keys (keys with a total ordering):

  1. Binary Search Tree is a dynamic data type
