/*
  Shortest path in complement graph. 
  Given a graph G, design an algorithm to find the shortest path (number of edges) between s and every other vertex in the complement graph G'. 
  The complement graph contains the same vertices as G but includes an edge v-w if and only if the edge v-w is not in G. 
  Can you do any better than explicitly computing the complement graph G' and running BFS in G'?
