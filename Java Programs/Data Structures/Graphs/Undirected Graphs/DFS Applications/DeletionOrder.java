/*
  Deletion order. 
  Given a connected graph, determine an order to delete the vertices such that each deletion leaves the (remaining) graph connected. 
  Your algorithm should take time proportional to V + E in the worst case.

  Delete a vertex without disconnecting a graph. 
  Given a connected graph, design a linear-time algorithm to find a vertex whose removal (deleting the vertex and all incident edges) does not disconnect the graph.
  Hint 1 (using DFS): run DFS from some vertex s and consider the first vertex in DFS that finishes.
  Hint 2 (using BFS): run BFS from some vertex s and consider any vertex with the highest distance.
