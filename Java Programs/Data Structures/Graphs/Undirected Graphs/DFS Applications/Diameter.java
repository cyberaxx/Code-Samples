/*
  Diameter of a tree. 
  Given a graph that is a tree (connected and acyclic), find the longest path,
  i.e., a pair of vertices v and w that are as far apart as possible. Your algorithm should run in linear time.

  Hint. Pick any vertex v. Compute the shortest path from v to every other vertex.
  Let w be the vertex with the largest shortest path distance. 
  Compute the shortest path from w to every other vertex.
  Let x be the vertex with the largest shortest path distance. The path from w to x gives the diameter.
