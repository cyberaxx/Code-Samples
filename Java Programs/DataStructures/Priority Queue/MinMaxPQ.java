/*
Min-max heap:
Design a data structure that supports min and max in constant time, insert, delete min, and delete max in logarithmic time by putting the items in a single array of size N with the following properties:

The array represents a complete binary tree.
The key in a node at an even level is less than (or equal to) the keys in its subtree; the key in a node at an odd level is greater than (or equal to) the keys in its subtree.

Note that the maximum value is stored at the root and the minimum value is stored at one of the root's children.
