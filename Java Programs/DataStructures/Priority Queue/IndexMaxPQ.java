/*
Index priority-queue implementation. Implement IndexMaxPQ.java by modifying MaxPQ.java as follows: Change pq[] to hold indices, add an array keys[] to hold the key values, and add an array qp[] that is the inverse of pq[] â€” qp[i] gives the position of i in pq[] (the index j such that pq[j] is i). Then modify the code to maintain these data structures. Use the convention that qp[i] is -1 if i is not on the queue, and include a method contains() that tests this condition. You need to modify the helper methods exch() and less() but not sink() or swim().
