/*

  In combinatorial mathematics, the Catalan numbers form a sequence of 
  natural numbers that occur in various counting problems, often involving 
  recursively-defined objects.

  The Catalan numbers satisfy the recurrence relation:
  c[0]=1
  c[n+1]=SUM(c[i]*c[n-i]) (For i=0 to n) for n>=0


  Catalan Number Applications:
  1. C[n] counts the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched.
  2. C[n] is the number of different ways n + 1 factors can be completely parenthesized (or the number of ways of associating n applications of a binary operator).
  3. C[n] is the number of rooted binary trees with n internal nodes (n + 1 leaves or external nodes).
