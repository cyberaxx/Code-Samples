/*
  The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem is the problem of finding the longest subsequence common
  to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences).

  Related problem:
  The longest common *substring* problem is to find the longest string (or strings) that is a 
  substring (or are substrings) of two or more strings.
