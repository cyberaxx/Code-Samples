NOTE:
Basic implementations for primitive data structures, search, and sort routines are highly influenced by algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/ and its corresponding coursera courses: https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-algorithms and https://www.coursera.org/learn/java-data-structures-algorithms-2.
